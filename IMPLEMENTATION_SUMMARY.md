# Trip Type and Cabin Class Preferences Implementation Summary

## âœ… Changes Completed

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added `tripType` column** to watches table with values: "oneway" | "roundtrip"  
- **Added `cabin` column** to watches table with values: "ECONOMY" | "PREMIUM_ECONOMY" | "BUSINESS" | "FIRST"
- **Database migration executed successfully** - updated 3 existing watches with default "roundtrip" preference

### 2. Search Page Enhancements (`src/app/search/page.tsx`)
- Added trip type selection (One-way / Round-trip radio buttons)
- Added cabin class dropdown (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First Class)
- Updated form validation to handle one-way vs round-trip requirements
- Enhanced `SearchReq` type to include `tripType` and `cabinClass` fields
- Updated API calls to pass cabin class preferences

### 3. Price Watch Modal Enhancements (`src/components/PriceWatchModal.tsx`)
- Added trip type preference selection in watch creation
- Added cabin class preference selection  
- Updated watch creation API calls to store user preferences
- Enhanced UI with proper form state management

### 4. Watch System Core Updates (`src/lib/watchStore.ts`)
- Updated `Watch` type definition with `tripType` and `cabin` fields
- Modified database prepared statements to include new columns
- Enhanced `insertWatch` and `updateWatch` functions

### 5. Watch Trigger System Fix (`src/app/edge/watch/[id]/trigger/route.ts`)
- **ðŸŽ¯ ROOT CAUSE FIXED**: Updated `generateDateCombinations` function to respect user's `tripType` preference
- **Eliminated hardcoded behavior**: No more forced one-way searches for round-trip preferences  
- Added cabin class to search parameters
- Improved logging to show trip type in console output

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

### Trip Type Function Validation
```
âœ… One-way results (should have NO return dates): âœ… PASSED
âœ… Round-trip results (should ALL have return dates): âœ… PASSED
```

### Expected Behavior Changes
- **Before**: All watches generated both one-way AND round-trip searches (causing unwanted notifications)
- **After**: Watches only generate searches matching user's selected trip type preference

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Resolution

### Original Issue
> "I am getting watch notifications for one-way tickets on frontier which I am surprised Amadeus actually has"

### Root Cause Found
Line 118 in `generateDateCombinations` was hardcoded: `// Try one-way first`

### Solution Implemented  
- User preferences now control search behavior
- Round-trip preference = only round-trip searches
- One-way preference = only one-way searches
- No more unwanted notification types

## ðŸš€ User Impact

### For Search
- Users can now specify trip type and cabin class before searching
- Search results match user preferences exactly
- Better user experience with targeted results

### For Price Watches
- Users set trip type and cabin class preferences when creating watches
- Watch notifications only include flights matching their preferences  
- No more unwanted one-way notifications for round-trip seekers
- No more economy notifications for business class seekers
