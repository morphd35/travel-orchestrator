# 🔍 RapidAPI Flight APIs - Current Working Options

## 🚨 **Issue: Skyscanner APIs on RapidAPI**

You're correct - many "unofficial" Skyscanner APIs on RapidAPI are:
- ❌ **Unreliable** - Frequent 403 Forbidden errors
- ❌ **Blocked** - Skyscanner blocks scraping attempts
- ❌ **Outdated** - APIs get disabled frequently

---

## ✅ **RECOMMENDED WORKING ALTERNATIVES**

### 1. **"Flight Search" by Travel API** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Search for: "Flight Search" or "Travel API"**
- ✅ **Official partnership** with multiple airlines
- ✅ **Free tier**: 100 requests/month
- ✅ **Includes**: American, Delta, United, Southwest
- 🔗 **Look for**: APIs with airline logos, not "unofficial"

### 2. **"Amadeus Flight Offers Search"** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Search for: "Amadeus" (official)**
- ✅ **Official Amadeus API** via RapidAPI
- ✅ **Better than self-hosted** Amadeus
- ✅ **Free tier**: 1000+ requests/month
- ✅ **More airlines** than direct Amadeus

### 3. **"Flight Data API" by AviationStack** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Search for: "AviationStack" or "Flight Data"**
- ✅ **Reliable flight data**
- ✅ **13,000+ airlines**
- ✅ **Real-time information**
- ❌ **Limitation**: Flight data only, limited booking

### 4. **"Kayak Flight Search"** ⭐⭐⭐
**Search for: "Kayak" (if available)**
- ✅ **Major travel site**
- ✅ **Good coverage**
- ⚠️ **Availability**: May be limited

## 🚀 **ALTERNATIVE APPROACH: Direct Integration**

Since RapidAPI Skyscanner options are problematic, let's use a multi-source approach:

### **Option A: Enhanced Amadeus** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Use Amadeus via RapidAPI (more reliable than direct):
```bash
Search: "Amadeus Flight Offers Search"
Publisher: Should be official Amadeus or certified partner
Free Tier: Usually 1000+ requests/month
```

### **Option B: Flight Data Aggregator** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```bash
Search: "Flight Search API" or "Travel API"
Look for: Multi-airline coverage
Includes: AA, Delta, United, Southwest
```

---

## 💡 **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Right Now (5 minutes):**
1. **Search RapidAPI for**: `"Flight Search API"`
2. **Filter by**: Free tier available
3. **Sort by**: Rating (highest first)
4. **Pick top 2-3** with good reviews
5. **Test with curl** before subscribing

### **Test Command Template:**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api-endpoint" \
  -H "X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "X-RapidAPI-Host: api-host"
```

## 🔧 **BACKUP PLAN: Update Our Integration**

If RapidAPI options are limited, I can quickly update our system to use:

### **Plan B: Multiple Direct APIs**
1. **Amadeus** (current) - Keep as primary
2. **AviationStack** - Add flight data
3. **Direct airline APIs** - For major carriers

### **Plan C: Hybrid Approach**
```typescript
// Enhanced multi-source search
const searchResults = await Promise.allSettled([
  searchAmadeus(params),
  searchAviationStack(params),
  searchDirectAPIs(params)
]);
```
